Parrot Refactoring Kata
=======================

Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful and polymorphic you can make it.

I made a [video explaining this kata](https://youtu.be/UxNEHKg_2eA), and another [video with a worked solution in C#](https://youtu.be/IvFX8Ivit1k).

Python version of the Parrot Refactoring Kata
=============================================

I recommend creating a virtual python environment for this project. You will need at least version 3.10 of Python. Then install the dependencies:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the tests:

    python -m pytest

Acknowlegements
---------------

This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring". It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already I suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
