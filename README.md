Parrot Refactoring Kata
=======================

Kata from Emily Bache, created in order to learn polymorphism. This is one attempt from me.

She made a [video explaining this kata](https://youtu.be/UxNEHKg_2eA), and another [video with a worked solution in Python]([https://youtu.be/IvFX8Ivit1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO_5DQ3vDtc&ab_channel=EmilyBache)).

Python version of the Parrot Refactoring Kata
=============================================

It is recommended to create a virtual python environment for this project. You will need at least version 3.10 of Python. Then install the dependencies:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the tests:

    python -m pytest

Acknowlegements
---------------

This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring". It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already Emily Bache suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
